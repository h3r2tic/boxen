The preferred way to update textures in dx10 is via a 'staging' texture, which is mapped into non-local vid memory, written to from the cpu and then copied into a local vid mem texture via CopySubresourceRegion.

GL has a way to map buffer memory in a way in which the coder must manually specify buffer updates. Is that equivalent?
